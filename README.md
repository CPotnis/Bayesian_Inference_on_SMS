# Bayesian Inference on SMS Spam Collection Data Set.

Being able to identify spam messages is a binary classification problem as messages are classified as either 'Spam' or 'Not Spam' and nothing else. Also, this is a supervised learning problem, feeding a labelled dataset into the Navie Bayes model, that it can learn from, to make future predictions.


## Installation

This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)


### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:


```bash
jupyter notebook Bayesian_Inference.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.
